          Reassurance About My Senior Dogâ€™s Well-Being

          My dog, Daisy, has been with me through so much, and now that she's
          getting older, I worry constantly about her health and happiness. I
          wanted to make sure she was comfortable and at peace as she aged, so I
          turned to Flute's pet psychics for some guidance. The psychic was able
          to connect with Daisy and gave me insight into how she was feeling. I
          learned that Daisy was content and that she felt loved and safe, which
          was a huge relief. The psychic also suggested some changes to make her
          more comfortable in her final years. The reassurance I received was
          invaluable, and I'm so grateful to Flute for helping me ensure Daisy's
          remaining time is filled with love and care.
